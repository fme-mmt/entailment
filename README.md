# Experiments in textual entailment

In this project we intend to tackle the task of identifying when a sentence follows from a set of premises.
The skeleton of our approach is the following.

# Syntactic analysis

A tree decomposition of the sentence is provided with some insight as to how the different parts of the statement interplay.

# Semantic transition

Making use of lambda calculus we transform the previously theoretically grounded content into applicable material.

# Logic meaning 

Now algorithms of nearly any order can be implemented over the previously obtained expression to infer certain properties so far hidden underneath the plain surface of the sentences. 

# Overall explainability & conclusions

Having gathered all the data a query is made and Kanren will be utilized to finally determine the dependency of the family of statements.
